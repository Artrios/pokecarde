Pokémon Card e
=========

This is a disassembly of the e-Reader cards released for Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire. Currently, it includes the English release of the Pokémon Battle e series, and the Eon Ticket.

RGBDS is needed to compile the Z80 binary for each card. To build a working e-Reader card, you will need to compress the binary with nevpk and add the card metadata with nedcenc—both tools are from the nedclib package, which is unfortunately Windows-only.
